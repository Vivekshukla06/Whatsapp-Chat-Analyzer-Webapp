Before you can get started, ensure that the following packages are installed in your Python environment (I recommend using Jupyter since you can see intermediate outputs easily while following the steps in this tutorial):
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter (Optional but useful since you can see intermediate outputs easily while following the steps in this tutorial) OR if you are lazy like me and donâ€™t feel like installing any of these packages, just head over to Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com) which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that comes with everything pre-installed, and get started in a jiffy!
